## Getting Started
<a name="getting-started"></a>
### What is Discord?
Discord is a communication platform that provides a combination of voice, video, and text communication services. Originally designed for gamers, Discord has evolved into a versatile platform used by various communities, businesses, and individuals for communication and collaboration.

### What is the discord.py library?
discord.py is an API wrapper for interacting with the Discord API using the Python programming language. It enables developers to create Discord bots and applications by providing a convenient and Pythonic interface to interact with the Discord platform.

## Idea
<a name="idea"></a>
I wanted to create a useful and efficient tool for other people to use. The main goals were to provide a way to automate 
repetitive tasks, manage the role/permission system interact with APIs outside of Discord to provide a seamless user experience.

### Implementation
<a name="implementation"></a>
First of all, I used technologies based on Python:
- Python Flask
- discord.py

I chose the Python Flask framework because I knew that it is lightweight and easy to use but that is not the only reason. I also know how to program with Python which made the backend development a lot easier. 
Flask made it easy for me to set up HTTPS-POST requests which helped me to communicate with APIs of other webservices. Therefore, I had no issues implementing my ideas.

### Deployment
<a name="deployment"></a>
After that I needed to deploy my application, so I tried to figure out the best way to do that without overspending money on expensive hardware. Questions like "Which operating system should I use?", or "How much computing power do I need for my application?" 
After some research I found out that my application is not as power hungry as I imagined and that Linux seemed to be a very good and lightweight operating system to deploy on. I settled with Linux and started looking into documentation to find out how to do it.
